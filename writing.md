In my opinion, sports and social activities are not as important as classes and libraries and the latter should receive more financial support. Though it is undeniable that the former do play crucial role in individual success and happiness, sports and social activities are more a self-displane than a program that the school can conduct in order to help student develope. Therefore, sports and social activities are not suitable for school financial support, and my reasons are follows:

Second, financial support to these items will not be effective. As far as I can see, sports and social activities are very personal 


Describe a celebration or moment which has made a deep impression on you. Please explain the impression and include specific examples and details in you explanation:

The most impressive moment I remember is when our school present gave a speech on the welcome meeting to the freshman. In his specch. he told us to stay healthy and work for our country for 50 years. His word stressed that, first we should exercise and keep healthy. Health is important than any other matters, like study or research. And second, we should think of our country frequently. If one only work for himself, he would probably lost his goal, but if one regard contribution to the country as the responsibility of himself, then his live would have a clear goal.

I hold that the use of cars will not decrease in near future, for personal vehicle industry still has its demand, capital and energy to survive and develop. 

First of all, there are large amount of demand for cars in developing cities, and the demand is even increasing with every day passes. On the one hand, cars are undeniably a flexible and convenient transportation. On the other hand, the possession of a personal car has become a metric for evaluating individual success in many cities, in countries like China, thus purchasing a car is still necessary for many young people. Moreover, as the urbanization proceeds, large number of developing cities emerge and every city would have demand for cars due to the reasons stated above. Therefore, the demand for cars are large and stable.

Next, car industry is a giant. Nowadays, we have the Forts, Toyota, Benz and many other giant companies. They have strong capital, enormous workers and complex economic relation. They are so influential that in near future, it would not be imaginable that the giant will fall, or it would be a world wide catastrophe. If there are any possibility of declination in car numbers, they would do anything to prevent it from happening. So these giant can and will foster the increase of cars.

Finally, car industry is now having new blood. New technologies like automatic cars, solar power cars, electric power cars are in rapid development and every high technology car have its promising prospect. Although car industry is obsessed with all kinds of environmental issues, the society is expecting its change instead of its extinction.

In summary, there are demand for new cars, there are capital to support car industry expansion, and there are internal energy to drive the development of car industry. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the number of cars will be increasing in the near future.

I agree that people are spending too much time on entertainment, at least much more than we used to do. My main point of view is that the development of technology makes entertainment more attractive, convenient and cost little.

First of all, I want to make a statement about human nature. Human are by nature a happiness driven animals. If there is an option to do things they like at no cost, no one will choose to do things that they should do. If it were not that severe consequence may occur if people don't do things they should do, the reality will be a mess. The should-do things usually means compulsory work, or responsibility that one should take, and in most cases things that people dislike.

Therefore as long as the cost to play is low enough and its attractiveness is large enough, enjoyment will overweight compulsory works. Nowadays, as the advance of technology, the borderline has already been reached, and entertainment is still proceeding.

Take smart phone as an example. In old days, playing computer games requires seating in front of the computer, holding mouse and keyboard, excluding all other work in your computer. Nowadays, with the invention of smart phones and touchable screens, more and more interesting cellphone games are available in smart phones. One only need two hands to play a cellphone game, which also has a distinctive interactive pattern than traditional games. Moreover, the place and time are not limited, indicating that you can make use of more sparse time.

In conclusion, as long as the cost to play is low enough and the enjoyment is pleasant enough, people will spend more time on entertainment. And now with the advance of technology, entertainment has undoubtbly surpassed compulsory works in people's mind, thus I hold that people are spending more time on entertainment.

I agree that life today is more comfortable than old days. The society is developing rapidly, and people's lives are also being improved. With progressively urbanization and industrialization, the issue of starvation, unemployment and illiteracy are significantly relieved.

About 50 years ago in my country, there is few ways to get higher education. Most people would not even finish primary school before they start to sow seeds and look after their agriculture land. For the minority that have a desire for college, it is usually impossible because there is no entrance to university opened for ordinary citizens.

Things got better in around 30 years ago, when National University Entrance Examination came into application. This exam is open to all people, including those relatively elderly people, who didn't have any chance to fulfill their college dream. Nowadays, this examination is still functioning, and is receiving more and more attention from the society. As the current society demands more and more highly educated students, most families place the education of children at the first place. So in the time I live, the education is far more available, accessible and valuable as compared to the time when my grandparents lived.

Another distinct improvement is the living standard. In my grandparents' time, most people struggle for survival because the food supplement is limited. There was another currency specialized for buying food, named food coupon. In other words, you need to have both money and coupon ready if you want to buy food. Thankfully in around 70s in the past century, a proeminent scientist invented a magic rice, which yields much more than previous kind and is easy to grow. Together with other technology advances, the food problem is larged solved in most regions in our country.

Finally, the entertainment also gets far more interesting. With the help of technology, we can watch delicate movies, listen to music from enormous singers and play games which are very attractive and even a bit of addictive. All those things were unimaginable dating back to old days. Entertainment is also an important part of people's everyday life, letting people escape temporarily from the reality and be happy without an expensive price.

In summary, our lives are greatly improved than our grandparents' live in many aspects.
